What I am working on:
Personal website

## About me
I like coding (unsurprisingly). My favorite programming languages are python, JavaScript, and GDScript. I have dabbled in C# before and am looking forward to making something in C, Rust, or some other language with memory control.

## Current Projects
### sandhaven
<sub>Will be open source when finished!<sub>

A sand simulation with over 20 different materials to play with!
### Personal website
A place to contact me, play my games, and interact with my other project. 

<sub>When it comes to websites, I have no clue what I am doing, so please, if you have advice, share it!</sub>
