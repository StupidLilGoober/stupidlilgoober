## About me
I like coding (unsurprisingly). My favorite programming languages are python, JavaScript, and GDScript (Godot Scripting Language). I have dabbled in C# before and am looking forward to making something in C, Rust, or some other language with memory control.

## Current Projects

### Rust-to-Python IPC

A place to contact me, play my games, and interact with my other project.
