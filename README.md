## About me
I like coding (unsurprisingly). My favorite programming languages are python, JavaScript, and GDScript. I have dabbled in C# before and am looking forward to making something in C, Rust, or some other language with memory control.

## Current Projects
### StupidMarkdown
A markup language that is a superset, inspired by, or whatever you want to call it of Markdown (what GitHub and Discord uses for formatting). Natively exports into HTML, allowing for easy web, app, or ui development.

> I may work on other exporting options if it gets popular, but as of current it can export to a folder with JSON and a TXT file, if you want to parse it yourself.

<sub>Will be FOSS once finished</sub>

### Personal website
A place to contact me, play my games, and interact with my other project. 

> When it comes to websites, I have no clue what I am doing, so please, if you have advice, share it!
