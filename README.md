What I am working on:
Sandhaven & Rust-to-Python IPC

## About me
I like coding (unsurprisingly). My favorite programming languages are python, JavaScript, and GDScript (Godot Scripting Language). I have dabbled in C# before and am looking forward to making something in C, Rust, or some other language with memory control.

## Current Projects
### Sandhaven
### Rust-to-Python IPC


### Personal website
A place to contact me, play my games, and interact with my other project. 

> When it comes to websites, I have no clue what I am doing, so please, if you have advice, share it!

## Finished projects
> Just because a project is "finished" doesn't mean I have stopped working on it, it just means it is released to the public.
