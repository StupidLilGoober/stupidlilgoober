What I am working on:
Sandhaven & Rust-to-Python IPC

## About Me
I like coding (unsurprisingly). My favorite programming languages are python, JavaScript, and GDScript (Godot Scripting Language). I have dabbled in C# before and am looking forward to making something in C, Rust, or some other language with memory control.

## Current Projects
### Sandhaven
A full sand simulation with 20+ elements, multiple
tools, and built-in moddability. It will all be licensed under the GNU License v3.

### Personal website
A place to contact me, play my games, and interact with my other project. 

> When it comes to websites, I have no clue what I am doing, so please, if you have advice, share it!
